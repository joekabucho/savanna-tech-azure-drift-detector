 Azure Drift Detector - System Design Document

 1.  Architecture Components:

1. Client Layer
   - Web Interface: Flask-based UI for user interaction
   - REST API: Swagger-documented endpoints for programmatic access

2. Application Layer
   - Authentication Service: Handles user auth via Azure AD
   - Drift Detection Service: Core business logic for detecting changes
   - Resource Polling Service: Collects Azure resource configurations
   - Notification Service: Manages alerts and notifications

3. Data Layer
   - PostgreSQL Database: Stores configurations, users, and audit logs
   - Redis Cache: Caches frequently accessed data and session info

4. External Services
   - Azure Resources: Monitored infrastructure
   - Azure AD: Authentication provider
   - Monitoring Stack: ELK, Prometheus, Grafana for observability

 Key Entities:

1. Tenant
   - Primary entity representing an organization
   - Contains tenant-specific settings and configurations
   - Links to Azure AD tenant ID

2. User
   - Represents system users
   - Belongs to a tenant
   - Has role-based permissions
   - Stores Microsoft authentication tokens

3. Configuration
   - Stores current state of Azure resources
   - Links to tenant
   - Contains resource type, ID, and configuration data
   - Maintains version history

4. SigningLog
   - Tracks Azure sign-in activities
   - Stores audit information
   - Links to tenant and resources

 3. Security Measures

1. Authentication & Authorization
   - Azure AD integration for enterprise authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Multi-tenant isolation
   - Token-based API authentication

2. Data Security
   - Encryption at rest for sensitive data
   - Secure credential management
   - Tenant data isolation
   - Audit logging for all operations

3. Application Security
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - Secure headers (Talisman)
   - Session management

 4. Scaling Challenges and Solutions

 Current Challenges:

   - Implement distributed polling
   - Add caching layer

3. API Scaling
   - Implement load balancing
   - Use application clustering
   - Add API gateway
   - Implement CDN for static content

 5. Scaling to 1M+ Users

 Infrastructure Changes:

1. Database
   - Implement database sharding
   - Use managed database service
   - Implement caching strategy
   - Add read replicas

2. Application

   - Load balancing
   - Service mesh

3. Monitoring
   - Distributed tracing
   - Real-time metrics
   - Automated scaling
   - Performance monitoring

 Code Changes:

1. API Layer
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add request queuing
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching

2. Polling Service
   - Implement distributed polling
   - Add worker pools
   - Implement backoff strategies
   - Add circuit breakers

 6. Potential Bottlenecks

1. Database Operations
   - Solution: Implement caching, read replicas, query optimization

2. Azure API Rate Limits
   - Solution: Implement rate limiting, backoff strategies

3. Resource Polling
   - Solution: Distributed processing, message queues

4. Authentication
   - Solution: Token caching, distributed session management

 7. Components Needing Redesign

1. Polling System
   - Current: Synchronous, single-threaded
   - Needed: Asynchronous, distributed

2. Database Layer
   - Current: Single instance
   - Needed: Sharded, replicated

3. Authentication
   - Current: Basic token management
   - Needed: Distributed session management

4. Monitoring
   - Current: Basic logging
   - Needed: Distributed tracing, metrics

 8. Technical Decision Log

 1. Multi-tenant Architecture
- Problem: Need to support multiple organizations
- Options:
  - Separate instances per tenant
  - Shared instance with tenant isolation
- Decision: Shared instance with tenant isolation
- Rationale: Better resource utilization, easier maintenance
- Trade-offs: 
  - Pros: Cost-effective, simpler deployment
  - Cons: Requires careful data isolation

 2. Authentication Strategy
- Problem: Secure user authentication
- Options:
  - Custom authentication
  - Azure AD integration
- Decision: Azure AD integration
- Rationale: Enterprise-grade security, SSO support
- Trade-offs:
  - Pros: Secure, maintainable
  - Cons: Azure dependency

 3. Database Choice
- Problem: Data storage and querying
- Options:
  - NoSQL (MongoDB)
  - SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Decision: PostgreSQL
- Rationale: ACID compliance, relational data model
- Trade-offs:
  - Pros: Data integrity, complex queries
